A Twitter client for old Macs

Currently very rudimentary, and a lot of the code is not particularly good. This is something I will work on: I intend to add a proper GUI, and clean up the library code as much as possible.

Contains code from other repositories:
  json-parser: https://github.com/udp/json-parser
  tinyhttp: https://github.com/mendsley/tinyhttp
  
and requires my PolarSSL port for MacOS to build:
  https://github.com/polarssl-macos
